            "If you have a pizza stone, place it on a rack in the middle of the oven. Heat the oven to 550°F (or maximum oven temperature) for at least 30 minutes.", 
            "If transferring the pizza to a stone in the oven, assemble on a well-floured peel or cutting board. Otherwise, assemble on the surface you will be cooking on (parchment paper, baking sheet, etc.). Working with one piece of dough at a time, roll or stretch it into a 10- to 12-inch circle. Brush the edges of the dough with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Spread half of the tomato sauce over the rest of the dough. Sprinkle with about a 1/4 of the cheese. Lay 4 prosciutto slices so they are evenly covering the dough. Sprinkle with another 1/4 of the cheese.", 
            "Bake the pizza until edges are lightly browned and cheese is bubbly and browned in spots, about 6 minutes at 550°F. Remove from oven to a cutting board, scatter half of the arugula over the top, and cut and serve immediately. Repeat with the remaining dough and toppings."
